## Minimum Consumption
MultiPost does not adopt a simple subscription system, but adopts a minimum consumption billing system.  
Simply put, when monthly consumption exceeds $1 but is less than $5, it needs to be charged according to $5.

East China Time Zone (Shanghai) UTC+8, settlement at 00:05 on the 1st of each natural month, counting the comprehensive consumption of the previous month. If it is less than $5 (but greater than $1), the difference will be made up to $5.  
If the previous month's consumption exceeds $5, no make-up will be made.  

For example:
> Total consumption in March: $2.5  
> Settlement on April 1st, found that last month's consumption was less than $5, so need to make up to $5  
> If at settlement time, account balance is $15, deduct $2.5, remaining $12.5  
> If at settlement time, account balance is $1, deduct $2.5, remaining $-1.5  

If last month's consumption is less than $1, no make-up will be made. If it exceeds $5, no make-up will be made either, just normal pay-as-you-go billing.
