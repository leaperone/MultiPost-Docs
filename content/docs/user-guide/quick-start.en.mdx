## Install MultiPost Extension and Start Using
Visit [Extension Page](https://multipost.app/extension) to install, then you can see the MultiPost icon in the browser toolbar.

Click it to start using, or create and publish content to multiple platforms at [multipost.app](https://multipost.app).

## Auto Publishing

Using MultiPost's auto publishing feature, simply create content in the [Publishing Page](https://multipost.app/dashboard/publish), then check the platforms you need to publish to and "Auto Publish", no secondary confirmation required.

Dynamic publishing now fully supports auto publishing functionality.

> Auto publishing feature may fail due to platform updates, please update extension version in time and [contact us](/docs/user-guide/contact-us) to report failure information.

## Automation or Integration into Your Code Projects
Please refer to [API Reference](/docs/api-reference) documentation.

### 5. When publishing videos, after clicking publish, it gets stuck, and only the target platform webpage opens after a long time. Why?
> The extension needs to load the video into the browser. If you check several platforms, it needs to load several copies of the video. When memory runs out, it will request virtual memory from the hard disk. Then disk usage maxes out and the browser freezes.
> Solutions:
> 1. Reduce platforms, only check the platforms you need;
> 2. Compress videos, control video size;
